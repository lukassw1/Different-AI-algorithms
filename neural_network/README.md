# Neural Network

The program implements a multilayer perceptron (MLP). The program solves the MNIST classification problem. The goal of the MNIST problem is to classify grayscale images of handwritten digits (8x8 pixels) into their corresponding numerical values (0-9). Additionally, I researched the influence of hyperparameters.

## Model Architecture

The MLP model consists of an input layer with 64 nodes (corresponding to the 8x8 input pixels), two hidden layers with (25, 10) nodes each, and an output layer with 10 nodes (corresponding to the 10 possible digits).

The activation function used in all layers is the Sigmoid function.

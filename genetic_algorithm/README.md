# Genetic Algorithm

The program implements a genetic algorithm and allows the creation of a transparent chart using a box plot from the matplotlib library. The program is tested on the exemplary rocket landing problem where every bit of the individual means usage a fuel unit. Additionally, I researched the influence of hyperparameters.

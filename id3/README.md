# ID3

The program implements an ID3 algorithm and allows the creation of a transparent chart using the matplotlib library. The program is tested on the data from 
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhadaneeraj/cardio-vascular-
disease-detection), where the program detects cardiovascular disease based on individual data. Additionally, I researched the influence of hyperparameters.
